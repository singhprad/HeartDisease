# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction project is a machine learning application aimed at predicting whether an individual is at risk of developing heart disease in the future. Using historical health data, this system assists in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

This project leverages various machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more. The final output is a binary classification where 1 indicates the presence of heart disease and 0 indicates its absence.

## Comprehensive Data Analysis
* Null values handling
* Categorical data encoding
* Outlier detection and removal
* Feature selection using correlation matrix
* Data scaling

## Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries Used:
  * Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
  * NumPy: For numerical computations.
  * Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  * Seaborn: For visualizing data distributions.
  * Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
The dataset used contains 14 features, including:
* Input Features:
  * Age
  * Sex
  * Chest Pain Type
  * Resting Blood Pressure
